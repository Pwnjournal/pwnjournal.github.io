You hold in one hand an encrypted datastream, and in the other the central core of a Golden Fang communications terminal. Countless spies have risked their lives to steal both the encrypted attack plans, and the technology used to conceal it, and bring them to you for expert analysis. To your horror, as you turn the screws on the core, its defense mechanisms spring to life, concealing and covering its workings. You have minutes to spare before the device destroys itself - can you crack the code?
